### Book Summary Section
**Section Title:** About the Book

In a world saturated with contradictions, *The Contradicted Existence* dares to confront the uncomfortable truths of human nature. This philosophical work examines selfishness not as vice but as existential necessity, explores the unity and duality of existence, and challenges readers to transcend the comfortable lies we tell ourselves.

Written originally in Arabic and self-translated by the author, this book strips away the masks of altruism and moral superiority to reveal the raw mechanisms of human behavior. From the nature of selfishness to the illusions of free will, from the abstract concept of the state to the mental states we call Heaven and Hell—each chapter builds a framework for understanding existence on its own terms.

This is not a book of answers. It is a mirror held up to the reader, reflecting the contradictions we embody, the power we deny, and the courage required to live authentically.

### Extended Description

*The Contradicted Existence* is a philosophical manifesto that refuses to console. 

Nassim El Hassouni dismantles comfortable illusions about human nature, morality, and purpose. Drawing on influences from Nietzsche, Camus, Spinoza, and Dawkins, while filtered through the author's unique Moroccan and legal background, this work presents 24 interconnected essays organized into three parts:

**Part One: The Nature of Self** examines human selfishness, the primacy of action over intention, the courage required for love, our fear of death, and our capacity for self-destruction. It argues that we are "the first domesticated animal"—tamed by ourselves, for ourselves.

**Part Two: The Contradicted Reality** explores the unity of existence, the illusion of free will, our need for belief systems, society's impact on individuality, and the abstract concept of the state. This section confronts the absurdity at the heart of existence itself.

**Part Three: Transcendence** offers a path beyond contradiction—not through resolution, but through acceptance. It examines consciousness and awareness, the mental states of heaven and hell, the need for belonging, and the pillars of true power: courage, love, and humility.

Unflinching in its assessment of human weakness and inspiring in its call for authentic strength, *The Contradicted Existence* is essential reading for anyone willing to confront life without the comfort of lies.

About the Author & the Book

### Author Section

**Nassim El Hassouni**
Writer, Philosopher

Born and raised in Tangier, Morocco, Nassim El Hassouni is a writer whose work confronts the fundamental contradictions of human existence with unflinching honesty. His background in law, fluency in three languages, and years of solitary writing have shaped a unique philosophical voice.

**Education & Background:**
- Bachelor's Degree in Private Law (Arabic Section), University of Abdelmalek Essaadi, Tangier (2020-2023)
- Four years as Sworn Clerk at a Bailiff's Office in Tangier (2020-2024)
- Native Arabic speaker with professional fluency in English and French

**Literary Journey:**

El Hassouni began writing seriously in 2021, producing a substantial body of standalone philosophical essays while working in Morocco's legal system and pursuing his law degree. This rigorous practice of thought and expression, conducted entirely in private, formed the foundation for his debut book.

*The Contradicted Existence* was conceived in 2022 and written throughout 2023-2024. Originally composed in Arabic, El Hassouni performed the translation himself to preserve the precise meaning and tone of his philosophical arguments. This commitment to linguistic authenticity reflects his broader dedication to truth over convenience.

**Philosophical Influences:**

El Hassouni's work engages with existentialist and naturalist philosophy, drawing on Nietzsche's critique of morality, Camus's confrontation with absurdity, Spinoza's unity of existence, and Dawkins's biological insights. However, his perspective is filtered through a Moroccan cultural lens and grounded in direct legal experience—offering a rare non-Western voice in contemporary philosophy.

**Current Work:**

Based in Tangier, Morocco, El Hassouni continues to write and develop his philosophical framework. He is committed to producing work that challenges readers to confront uncomfortable truths about human nature, power, and existence.

### About the Book Section

**The Making of The Contradicted Existence**

*The Contradicted Existence* emerged from a sustained period of philosophical inquiry and personal confrontation with life's fundamental questions. Written between 2023 and 2024 in Tangier, Morocco, the book represents the distillation of years of private writing and reflection.

**Original Composition:**

The book was written originally in Arabic, allowing El Hassouni to think through complex philosophical problems in his native language. This linguistic origin gives the work a distinctive rhythm and approach to argumentation that differs from typical Western philosophical writing.

**Translation Philosophy:**

Rather than hire a translator, El Hassouni performed the English translation himself—a painstaking process that ensured no philosophical nuance was lost. This decision reflects the book's central theme: that authentic truth requires uncomfortable personal responsibility rather than delegation to others.

**Intellectual Framework:**

The book is organized into three parts that build upon each other:

1. **The Nature of Self** establishes the biological and psychological foundations of human behavior
2. **The Contradicted Reality** examines the paradoxes inherent in existence itself
3. **Transcendence** offers a path beyond contradiction through acceptance and power

Each of the 24 chapters can stand alone as an essay, but together they form a comprehensive philosophical framework for understanding human existence.

**Cover Art:**

The cover was designed by Asmae Hamidouche, whose visual interpretation captures the book's themes of duality, contradiction, and the stark beauty of truth.

**Why This Book Matters:**

In an era of comforting lies and therapeutic culture, *The Contradicted Existence* offers something increasingly rare: philosophical honesty that refuses to console. It challenges readers to abandon their comfortable self-deceptions and confront the truth of their nature—not to destroy them, but to liberate them for authentic power and love.

This is philosophy as confrontation, not comfort.

### INTRODUCTION

This book is a mere attempt to understand my existence and existence itself, an attempt that could be right or wrong on all scales.

I am not trying to convince you or change your beliefs. I am not endorsing hate speech or encouraging violence; that is not my goal and never was and never will be. All I want from you, the reader, is an open mind—a willingness to consider a new perspective and new ways of approaching life and how we see ourselves. This work is built on the fertile ground of thought and consciousness, and on all the thinkers who existed before me.

I wrote this book in Arabic and did the translation and editing myself to ensure the meaning was not changed.

Thank you, and I love you.

**Question marks**

Where have our moments of joy and sorrow gone, vanished into history's endless scroll? What lies waiting for us, hidden in the folds of time? Where is this life, so full of surprises, taking us? Where did the fish we eat once swim in the ocean? Which field bore the grains that became our bread? From which river did we drink to quench our thirst? Who plucked the grapes that now fill our cup with wine?

What do we do with this fleeting moment in our hands, the only thing that truly belongs to us? Do we waste it, breathe life into it? Or simply stand by, watching it slip away through our fingers like sand? What am I chasing with my ambition, which made me forsake another dream, another life that could have been mine in a parallel reality? What hidden force drives us to seek happiness and flee from pain?

In every moment, I dissolve like a chemical reaction, creating another self, another story, another reaction. Each day, I carve my grave and prepare my rest, surrendering to the silence of night. Yet at dawn comes defiance with a spirit rising from the ashes, seizing a new day, a new chance. I come from nothingness, and to nothingness I shall return. Between these voids, I simply am.

Who am I? One is not confined to a name, nor bound by lineage, nor reduced to mere humanity. What matters in the grand scheme of "I" is that I exist. And all that exists is contained by existence itself. Therefore, I am EXISTENCE.

---

### CHAPTER 1: You Are Selfish

Wherever one examines nature's components, one sees selfishness embodied through them, indicating that the whole is pure selfishness. What does existence seek? Any word other than existence itself would be wrong; the purpose of existence is existence itself.

The implication is that existence is selfish, which means it is an end in itself.

Consequently, all parts of existence are an end in themselves and a means for existence to achieve its purpose.

This means that we, as parts and as humanity, are selfish. Since the dawn of consciousness, humanity has been achieving selfish accomplishments and goals until we reached the highest stages of the food chain. The lions and tigers we once feared have become circus cats and trophies hanging on our walls. Through our selfishness, we have caused the extinction of species and the domestication of others. Our selfishness allows us to build farms and pastures for sheep, cattle, and chickens to be cooked and served on our tables. We feed them, fatten them, and protect them against diseases until they reach the slaughterhouse, where they offer themselves as sacrifices to us; the same applies to plants.

Thus, rendering themselves palatable food for us became their selfish means of conquering the world to reach populations they could not have achieved without our aid.

This leads us to the truth that every interaction one part has with another inevitably fulfills each part's selfishness through the other.

We as parts are selfish in ourselves; by the concept of opposition, we stand in a position of selfishness toward the other. Everything exchanged between us is our selfishness: in the language of physicists, our time and energy; in the language of priests, our virtues and vices.

This brings us to humans as a link in the chain of parts amid a natural selfish struggle for existence to realize itself. The individual comes to say that he is not selfish and we should not be selfish. This claim, if it indicates anything at all, reveals pathological signs of a weak self and a decayed set of societal values: an attempt by some individuals to absolve themselves of their selfish nature so they can tolerate their natural reality and continue existing. In doing so, they grant themselves the right to absolve and soothe themselves from the pain and suffering imposed by the truth of their inherent selfishness.

I see you, weak creatures, shrouded in the illusions of your minds in an attempt to impose your weakness on all who are stronger than you. Your fate is to perish sooner or later, for everyone in whom the will of nature has weakened, nature devours; they perish due to the deadly poison within them, for every repressed and unfree selfishness makes its owner sick with an incurable disease that eats them from within.

The claim of altruism is a pathological condition indicating a weak self that cannot keep pace with reality and accept its existential truth. It is like the recoil movement of the sacrificial animal's legs after slaughter, and humanity must take caution from this type, for the will of weakness has taken hold of them and it is too late to save what can be saved. They are like a gangrenous toe that must be amputated before the infection spreads throughout the body.

Accepting the truth of our selfishness is an existential necessity: I am selfish, therefore I exist. This statement is more authentic than Descartes' cogito. Without my selfishness, I would be nothing; it is Dawkins' idea of the selfish gene.

The common mistake made by those who attempt to transcend their selfishness is believing that they are something outside of nature and thus denying the truth of their natural selfishness. With their condescending view of their mother and incubator, they have exposed themselves to weakness. Their view of themselves as unselfish does not negate the truth of their selfishness but transforms it into pathological selfishness. Natural selfishness is when one realizes the truth of one's selfishness and that one is both an end and a means for existence's selfishness.

The presence of the other in our lives is necessary to create balance in the individual so that one can withstand the continuous blows directed at us by existence. However, the other is sometimes the blow that existence has directed at us, like a curved ball heading to crush us.

On this consideration, one must discover the other carefully and delve into their depths more than all those close to us, because this other often gives us a better understanding of human nature, its motives, and its operating mechanism. The lesson this other teaches us will accompany us throughout life and remain tattooed on our souls.

The ego, during its interaction with the other, likes to be the center of the other's existence, as if the other exists to satisfy its desires and glorify its selfishness. The ego likes to exploit the other and hates to be exploited by them: a sadistic relationship in which the ego sees the other as a tool harnessed for it in the struggle of life. In the ego's self-absorption and preoccupation with its own importance, it crushes the other's ego without paying any attention to its importance as well, forming in the other, or rather in the other's ego, a feeling of contempt, resentment, and hatred due to the lack of attention paid to it and the failure to satisfy each other's vanity. All this will inevitably lead to the explosion of the other's ego in our faces, thus shattering our sense of self.

Here, one must never forget the truth of human selfishness. My selfishness is always met with the selfishness of the other, and we must never, under any excuse, give greater importance to our selfishness at the expense of the other's selfishness. Otherwise, such a relationship would constitute a master-slave relationship. The master always seeks to magnify his ego through his slave without the slave ever showing his ego and selfishness in the orbit of the relationship between him and his master; otherwise, he would be flogged.

One becomes master of oneself by refusing to obey the ego's demands and by assuming the observer role to understand one's ego. One should also seek what the other's ego and selfishness desires and care about it. Then one will not only be master to oneself but also master to all, if one does so with an understanding of how the ego operates: that part of us that ordinary people are deceived into thinking is their true self. The truth is they have been deceived by the image represented in their minds about themselves; that image exists only in their imagination. One's self is much greater than one's ego, name, family, position, ambitions, and relationships with others.

The way to self-realization and knowledge remains in understanding and accepting the ego, which blinds our eyes and makes us fenced in, closed, and concerned with ourselves or the image we believe is our self.

There is a fundamental difference between natural selfishness and pathological selfishness.

The first is where one is aware of one's selfish nature, neither denying nor rejecting it, aware of its inherent dangers, avoiding its evil as much as possible and sometimes using it to one's advantage.

The second differs significantly in all its components from the first, as all its contents have been inverted to transform into a monster walking on two legs in an arrogant, narcissistic human form. This personality hates every selfish person and opposes every selfish idea that calls for accepting individuality. Instead, it calls for accepting the unselfish doctrine, where the human animal seeks to disavow its natural skin to wrap itself in a transcendent, sublime blanket above its nature.

However, the deniers of their original nature will never be able to know themselves and see selfishness in their altruistic actions; in their view, their actions are not selfish, and others are the selfish ones who do not live up to their standards. Thus, they become prisoners of their illusions.

Still, if someone points to their repressed self within them due to their arrogance and lack of awareness of their essence, they flog themselves more and more and bury it in their subconscious with the sands of oblivion, increasing their desire to impose their sick ideas on others, for no reason other than that they did not accept the reality of their selfishness.

The first stage of healing begins when someone strips away the masked nature of our patients to confront them with reality. One must even dare to strike a blow to that patient's narcissism to remove the illusory robe that protects them from the frost of their existence.

This escapism is nothing but a result of fear of the glowing beam within them. It is the one fleeing from oneself that screams in the depths of one's soul, where one hears only the echoes of ghost voices, which instills terror in our patient's heart.

They are like someone who attended a masquerade party wearing a horse mask and when they looked in the mirror, they convinced themselves they were a horse, and their natural selfishness became a prisoner of the mask. The mask dictates their behaviors and thoughts and they interact based on what is dictated to them by the mask.

Natural selfishness is one of the characteristics of powerful humans. They accept their selfishness to the extent that they accept the absurdity and contradictions of their existence.

Here, the human is aware of one's essence and acts on one's selfish nature without denying it so that one can face life and its inherent suffering without psychological diseases.

### CHAPTER 11: Existence is Contradicted

We wake up, have breakfast, go to work, have lunch, return from work, and sit in cafes and bars. Everyone is bound to their phone, browsing social media. We watch football games, have dinner, lie in bed, sleep, and wake up again. And so, the days go on.

We laugh, grieve, listen to others' stories, tell our own stories, call our mothers, and our siblings call us. We go for a drive with a friend or take a short walk. We head to the beach on hot days and to snowy areas in winter.

We grow up, get married, have children, get divorced. Children grow up half-matured; the child feels lonely, depressed, and euphoric. We feel lonely even amidst family and society.

We make laws, then break them, and go to prison for breaking the law to become rehabilitated citizens. Prison makes us more criminal. Those who imprison us are the same ones who break the law.

We build mosques, churches, and temples. We get closer to God and pray for Him to fulfill our wishes.

We are happy, and then illness comes to feed on that happiness. We manufacture weapons, and we fabricate wars to sell those weapons. People die, and men fight each other without knowing the real reason why they are fighting. Meanwhile, the sun rises and sets, the moon waxes and wanes, stars stud the sky, rain falls and turns into floods, and people drown.

We raise pets and treat them better than we treat each other. An earthquake, followed by a tsunami, a volcano erupts, fires break out, drought strikes, and livestock and animals perish.

A man in the open air wraps himself in the sky, not having enough clothes to protect him from the cold. Another man in his luxurious home walks around in his silk clothing, heads to the kitchen, feeds his dog a piece of meat, takes a bottle of the finest whiskey, and pours a glass as Bach's music plays.

A faithful woman is cheated on by her husband, who does not love her. A loyal husband returns home early from work to find his wife in his bed with another man. He takes the gun, shoots them, and goes to the children's room. Two gunshots are heard, and after a short moment, the last bullet is fired.

A broken man enters the grocery store, buys a rope, goes to a nearby forest, then hangs himself.

Music is composed, novels and poems are written, films are made, paintings are drawn, and we dance and sing.

We elect presidents, pledge allegiance to kings, coups occur, people are oppressed, and activists are arrested. A man is crushed in a garbage truck. A man drives a bus and heads toward the sidewalk to run over people like a game. A teenager carries a machine gun, heads to his school, and starts shooting. News is broadcast on radio and television. Everyone watches and listens. Days pass, and everything is forgotten in the depths of history.

We divide the earth into sections and call them borders; wars arise because of these imaginary borders. We own land, we die, that land is inherited, and conflict arises over inheritance. We created money and kept chasing after it. We created states and let them rule us, restrict our freedom, and imprison us.

And within all these contradictions and absurd irrational events that we have been forced to coexist with, two pivotal questions must occur in one's mind at least once in one's life.

The first is why? Why all this? What is the purpose behind everything that happens? Is there a purpose in the first place? Or are we condemned to coexist with this reality without knowing the answer to such a question? Are we unable to answer it?

The second is, is this the best we can do? Yes, at this moment, this is the best we can do because it is reality: this is us. But are we not capable of doing more than we have achieved? Our intelligence and scientific and technological progress all go to waste if we do not employ them for the benefit of every individual; instead, they are evidence of our poverty and stupidity.

If existence is without meaning, the only meaning left for it is meaninglessness. Therefore, we must establish the meaning that suits us as individuals and then as humanity in a way that serves the interests of all individuals.

Our consciousness of existence is formed through the data that enters our brain from our environment and surroundings. The child, while creating their consciousness, is given a meaning for their existence and existence in general by their family and society and what humanity has produced since its dawn up to the present time; a meaning tailored according to the size of their culture, and most people are accompanied by that meaning from youth to the grave, and religious ideologies have long been fertile ground for building that meaning and giving value to our existence.

The evolution of the human mind cannot discover a meaning for existence or grasp the naked truth: the truth of why existence exists. This is what no human mind can find. We are left only to give meaning to our existence with the fact that the meaning we color our existence with is contrast; we imagine the existence of a shiny color, and the truth of the matter is that two colors give meaning to our existence: white and black, good and evil, death and life.

This truth brings down every symbol and every God and shatters all other truths. It strips kings of their euphoria with thrones, and all human values that humanists trumpet become of no significant value, nothing, without meaning.

If not for the genius rebel Camus, the whole world would have become a pool of blood filled with corpses and vultures hovering over them. Taking his wisdom, one must rebel against this absurd truth and draw the boundaries of the meaning with which one will live by in this world.

Love and art remain the best antidote to treat the malignant poison of nihilism.

**For You:**

I am life in a child chasing butterflies in a green field,
wrinkles on the face of an old man worn out by time,
in two lovers kissing each other tenderly and passionately
or a married couple quarreling and exchanging insults.

I am life embodied in a man who gives all he has
to help the poor and needy
Or a rich man who looks at the poor with disdain.

I live within the tunes of music,
in paintings,
lines of poetry,
and within a Russian novel.

I am life wherever life is found, and I exist where death exists.

What is life other than a lion killing other lions' cubs,
hyenas tearing the flesh of their prey alive,
a snake lurking to pounce on its victim?
A pedophile, a serial killer, a parricide, and a suicide.

I live in the heart of a father who tirelessly supports his family,
Or a drunk father who returns home
to shower his family with beatings and insults.
an affectionate mother who lavishes love on her children,
a mother who killed her newborn,
a madman roaming the streets barefoot,
a child born with a birth defect or born sane
then had his feet amputated or became blind,
a homeless woman raped by rabble in a dark alley,
a beautiful face that captivates hearts,
or an ugly face full of pimples that invite repulsion.

I am life in the breeze that fans the burning fires.
I am the wood and the fire and the rain.
I am a part in the whole, One and only, unique.
I am the guillotine and the judge and the criminal
and the severed head;
I am the shackled hand.

I am anger, joy, misery, happiness, ecstasy, depression.
I am existence, I exist for the purpose of existing.
I am constantly moving and changing.
For life to exist, there must be everlasting and change.

### Content & Themes

**Q: Is this book religious?**

A: No. While the book discusses religious ideologies and their role in human consciousness, it is fundamentally a secular philosophical work. The author argues that humanity must transcend religious frameworks to achieve full maturity.

**Q: Is the book nihilistic?**

A: The book confronts nihilism directly but does not advocate for it. Chapter 13 explicitly addresses escaping the "trap of nihilism" through acceptance, love, and the creation of authentic meaning. The final section on Transcendence offers a path beyond both nihilism and false consolation.

**Q: Does the book offer practical advice?**

A: This is primarily a work of philosophy, not self-help. However, the final section (Part Three: Transcendence) offers frameworks for authentic living based on the philosophical foundations established earlier. The practical implications emerge from understanding, not from prescriptive rules.

**Q: What are the main influences on this book?**

A: The book engages explicitly with:
- Nietzsche (on selfishness, power, and the critique of morality)
- Camus (on absurdity and rebellion)
- Spinoza (on the unity of existence)
- Richard Dawkins (the selfish gene)
- Maslow (hierarchy of needs)
- Hobbes (human nature and the state)

It also draws implicitly on existentialist philosophy, Islamic intellectual tradition, and the author's legal background.

**Q: Are there trigger warnings I should know about?**

A: The book contains frank discussions of:
- Death and mortality
- Self-destruction
- Sexual instinct and desire
- Violence and war
- Loneliness and despair
- The inadequacy of conventional morality

The author's poetry in the Afterword references addiction, violence, poverty, and human suffering.

Readers seeking gentle or uplifting content should look elsewhere.

**Q: Who designed the cover?**

A: The cover art was created by Asmae Hamidouche.

**Q: Is there an index?**

A: No. The book includes a detailed Table of Contents and an Afterword with original poetry, but no index.

**Q: Are footnotes or citations included?**

A: The book references various thinkers and ideas within the text but does not use academic footnotes. This is philosophical essay, not academic scholarship.

### Terms and Conditions

Last updated: December 31, 2025

Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms") carefully before using the www.mentisaura.com website (the "Service") operated by Mentis Aura LLC ("us", "we", or "our"), a Wyoming Limited Liability Company, an e-commerce platform dedicated to selling books authored by Nassim El Hassouni.

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who wish to access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the Terms, you do not have permission to access the Service.

#### Purchases

If you wish to purchase any product made available through the Service ("Purchase"), you will proceed directly to checkout without creating an account. You may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase, including your name, email address, shipping address, and payment details.

You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct, and complete.

We use third-party services for payment processing (Stripe) and order fulfillment (print-on-demand printing and shipping). By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy. We do not store complete payment card details; all payment information is encrypted and processed securely by Stripe. Refer to Stripe's privacy policy at https://stripe.com/privacy for details on their data handling practices.

Books are produced on-demand after purchase. Processing times may vary based on printing facility capacity and location. By placing an order, you acknowledge and accept potential delays beyond estimated delivery windows due to factors including but not limited to printing queue times, shipping carrier performance, customs processing, and force majeure events.

Prices displayed on the Service do not include shipping costs, VAT, customs duties, or any other taxes or fees, which may be added during checkout or upon delivery depending on your location. You are responsible for all such additional charges.

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time for reasons including but not limited to: product availability, errors in the description or price of the product, errors in your order, suspected fraud or unauthorized transactions, or other reasons.

#### Refunds and Returns

All sales are final. We provide a detailed table of contents and a sample chapter for each book to ensure you are fully informed about the content before purchasing. No refunds, exchanges, or returns are accepted except in the following circumstances:

- Manufacturing defects (e.g., printing errors, binding issues) or damage during shipping. If this occurs, contact us within 7 days of receipt with photographic evidence, and we will provide a replacement at no additional cost.
- Order fulfillment errors (e.g., wrong book shipped). We will correct this promptly at no cost to you.

We do not provide refunds for buyer's remorse, changes of mind, disagreement with content, or issues related to additional fees like customs duties or taxes.

**EU Consumer Rights:** If you are a consumer located in the European Union, please note that the right of withdrawal does not apply to this purchase. Books sold through our Service are produced on-demand specifically for each order and therefore constitute customized goods under Article 16(c) of the EU Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU), which exempts them from the standard 14-day cooling-off period.

#### Payment Disputes and Chargebacks

If you dispute a charge with your payment provider (chargeback), we reserve the right to:
- Suspend or terminate your access to the Service
- Provide evidence of fulfilled order to payment provider
- Pursue collection of disputed amounts if chargeback is deemed fraudulent

We reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.

#### Termination

We may terminate or suspend access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including but not limited to a breach of the Terms.

All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

#### Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Mentis Aura LLC and its employees, contractors, agents, officers, and directors (if any), from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs, or debt, and expenses (including attorney's fees), resulting from or arising out of your use of the Service or a breach of these Terms.

#### Limitation of Liability

In no event shall Mentis Aura LLC, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates (if any), be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; or (iv) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage.

You waive any right to participate in class action lawsuits or class-wide arbitration.

#### Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Wyoming, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver. If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in effect. These Terms constitute the entire agreement regarding our Service and supersede any prior agreements.

#### Changes

We reserve the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will provide at least 30 days' notice on the Service prior to new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to use the Service after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.

### Shipping and Returns Policy

Last updated: December 31, 2025

Mentis Aura LLC strives to provide reliable worldwide shipping for our books. This policy outlines our shipping process, estimated delivery times, costs, and returns guidelines. Please read it carefully before making a purchase.

#### Shipping Process

We use print-on-demand services for printing and fulfillment. Once your order is placed and payment is confirmed via Stripe:

1. **Order Processing:** Your order is transmitted to a print-on-demand facility located closest to your shipping address to minimize delivery times and costs.

2. **Printing:** Your book is printed specifically for your order. This typically takes 3-5 business days, though production times may vary based on facility capacity and order volume.

3. **Quality Check:** Each book undergoes quality inspection before shipping.

4. **Shipping:** Once printing and quality checks are complete, your book is packaged and shipped via the selected shipping method.

5. **Tracking:** You will receive a transactional email confirmation with tracking information when your order ships (tracking availability depends on shipping method and carrier).

We ship worldwide, but delivery times and costs vary by destination.

#### Shipping Costs

Shipping costs are **not included** in the displayed book price and will be calculated and added during checkout based on:

- Your shipping address
- The weight and dimensions of the book
- The selected shipping method (standard or expedited, where available)
- Current carrier rates

**Additional Fees:**  
VAT, customs duties, import taxes, brokerage fees, and other charges may apply depending on your country's regulations. **These fees are your responsibility** and may be collected by the carrier upon delivery or at customs clearance.

We recommend checking your local customs policies and import regulations before purchasing. We are not responsible for delays or additional costs resulting from customs processing.

#### Estimated Delivery Times

Delivery times are estimates and **not guaranteed**, as they depend on printing facility capacity, shipping carrier performance, customs processing, and other factors beyond our control:

**Domestic Shipping (within printing facility's country):**  
- Standard: 5-10 business days total (including 3-5 days printing + 2-5 days shipping)
- Expedited: 4-7 business days total (where available)

**International Shipping:**  
- Standard: 10-20 business days total (including 3-5 days printing + 7-15 days shipping)
- Expedited: 7-14 business days total (where available)

**Please note:** International deliveries may take longer due to customs processing, which can add 1-4 weeks in some regions. Delivery times to remote or rural areas may be extended.

Delays can occur due to high demand periods (holidays), weather events, carrier issues, customs inspections, global shipping disruptions, or force majeure events. We are not liable for delays beyond our reasonable control.

#### Order Tracking

Where available, tracking information will be provided in your shipping confirmation email. Tracking updates depend on the carrier and shipping method selected.

To track your order:
1. Check the shipping confirmation email for the tracking number
2. Visit the carrier's website and enter the tracking number
3. Allow 24-48 hours after shipping for tracking information to update

If tracking shows no movement for more than 5 business days (domestic) or 10 business days (international), contact us at support@mentisaura.com for assistance.

#### Shipping Issues

**Lost Packages:**  
If your package is marked as delivered but you have not received it:
1. Check with neighbors, building management, or household members
2. Verify the shipping address provided was correct
3. Contact the carrier directly using the tracking number
4. Wait 48 hours (sometimes packages are marked delivered prematurely)
5. If still not located, contact us at support@mentisaura.com within 7 days of the delivery date

We will investigate with the carrier and provide a resolution (replacement or refund) for confirmed lost packages.

**Damaged Packages:**  
If your book arrives damaged:
1. Take clear photos showing the damage (both packaging and book)
2. Contact us at support@mentisaura.com within 7 days of receipt
3. Include your order number and photos

We will provide a replacement at no additional cost for books damaged during shipping.

**Wrong Address:**  
If you provided an incorrect shipping address, we cannot modify the order after it has been transmitted to the print facility. If the package is returned to the sender, we will contact you to arrange reshipping (additional shipping costs will apply). We are not responsible for packages delivered to incorrect addresses provided by the customer.

#### Returns and Refunds

**All sales are final.** We do not accept returns, exchanges, or refunds for change of mind or dissatisfaction with content.

**Why no returns?**  
We provide a detailed table of contents and a sample chapter for each book on the product page. These resources allow you to make an informed decision about the book's content before purchasing. Since our books are printed on-demand specifically for each order, they cannot be resold.

**Exceptions:**  
We will provide a replacement or refund in the following circumstances:

1. **Manufacturing Defects:**  
   - Printing errors (missing pages, illegible text, incorrect binding)
   - Quality issues (misprints, poor print quality)
   - Contact us within 7 days of receipt with photos showing the defect

2. **Shipping Damage:**  
   - Book arrived damaged (torn pages, crushed binding, water damage)
   - Contact us within 7 days of receipt with photos

3. **Order Fulfillment Errors:**

#### EU Consumer Rights

If you are a consumer located in the European Union, please note that the standard 14-day right of withdrawal does not apply to this purchase.

**Legal Basis:**  
Under Article 16(c) of the EU Consumer Rights Directive (2011/83/EU), the right of withdrawal does not apply to "the supply of goods made to the consumer's specifications or clearly personalized."

Since our books are produced on-demand specifically for each order (not held in stock), they constitute customized goods exempt from the withdrawal right. By placing an order, you expressly acknowledge and agree to this exemption.

This exemption does not affect your rights for defective products. If you receive a book with manufacturing defects or shipping damage, we will provide a replacement or refund as described above.
