Hi,
Attached is the original website content MD. Below are the exact changes needed. Everything else stays as is.

1. Hardcover page count → 102 pages
The hardcover is 102 pages, not 112. Update it everywhere the hardcover is listed (Home purchase section, Bookshelf formats, FAQ formats). Paperback and eBook stay at 110. The FAQ question "What is the page count?" should also reflect this.

2. Paperback and eBook page count → 110 pages
Both are 110 pages, not 112. Update everywhere they are listed (Home page Book Details, Home purchase section, Bookshelf formats, FAQ formats, FAQ page count answer).

3. Support line
Change "Direct support to the author" → "Direct support available"

4. Remove the Author's Note on Translation completely
The entire section — heading, quote, and attribution. Delete it all.

5. My title on the About page
The line should read: "Writer, Philosopher" — remove only the word "Translator" from that line.

6. Newsletter subscribe link
Wherever you see [Subscribe link], plug in the actual newsletter signup URL. It appears in two places: the About page contact block and the FAQ under "Where can I follow the author's work?"

7. Language field (Bookshelf page)
Change the Language line to: Originally written in Arabic, translated to English by the author. Three sections were written directly in English: "Know Thyself," "Transcendence and Manifestation," and the poem in "Existence is Contradicted."

8. Sample Chapters — replace with these three, FULL text
Remove the current four sample chapters entirely. Replace with:
The full Introduction
The full Chapter 1 (You Are Selfish)
The full Chapter 11 (Existence is Contradicted)
No truncation, no "[Continue reading...]" — the whole chapter each time.

9. eBook formats
Change "Available in multiple formats" → "Available in PDF". Do this everywhere eBook formats are listed (Home, Bookshelf, FAQ).

10. Remove these completely — don't replace, just delete:
My personal email: nassim.el.hassouni@outlook.com (appears twice — once in the About page contact block, once in the FAQ speaking engagements answer)
The line about me being a freelance translator (appears in the Home page author bio and in the FAQ background answer — cut the freelance part, keep the rest of the sentence)
The entire ISBN Q&A in the FAQ ("What is the ISBN?" and its answer). Also remove the ISBN field from the Bookshelf page.

11. "Pre-order" → "Order"
Find "Pre-order the book" and change it to "Order the book".

12. New FAQ answer
The question "Will there be more books from Mentis Aura?" is already there. Replace the current answer with just: YES.

13. Press email
Use press@mentisaura.com for anything media or industry-facing. Specifically:
FAQ speaking engagements answer (where the personal email was)
FAQ review copy request answer
Contact page: the Media section and the Publishers/Distributors section

Thanks,
Nassim El Hassouni
